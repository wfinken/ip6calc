    "ipv6_what_is": {
        "title": "What is IPv6?",
        "simple_explanation": "It's the modern upgrade to the internet's addressing system. The old system (IPv4) ran out of space years ago. IPv6 fixes this by providing a practically infinite number of addresses, better security features built-in, and smoother connections for mobile devices."
    },
    "compression": {
        "title": "The Double Colon (::)",
        "simple_explanation": "IPv6 addresses are naturally very long (32 numbers!). Because they often contain long strings of zeros, we use a '::' as a shortcut to say 'fill this empty space with zeros'. It keeps things tidy."
    },
    "prefix": {
        "title": "The Network Prefix (e.g., /64)",
        "simple_explanation": "This number splits the address into two parts: the 'Neighborhood' (Network) and the 'House' (Interface). A /64 is the standard standard size for a single local network (like your home Wi-Fi)."
    },
    "address_type_global_unicast": {
        "title": "Global Unicast Address",
        "simple_explanation": "A Public Internet Address. This address is globally unique and can route data anywhere on the internet. If you have this, you are 'live' to the world."
    },
    "address_type_link_local": {
        "title": "Link-Local Address (fe80::)",
        "simple_explanation": "A Local-Only Address. Every IPv6 device creates one of these automatically to talk to neighbors on the same wire or Wi-Fi. It cannot go onto the wider internet."
    },
    "address_type_loopback": {
        "title": "Loopback Address (::1)",
        "simple_explanation": "The 'Self' Address. This is used by the computer to send messages to itself for testing or internal communication."
    },
    "scale": {
        "title": "The Infinite Scale",
        "simple_explanation": "IPv6 is 128-bit, while IPv4 is 32-bit. This isn't just 4 times bigger; it's exponentially massive. We will effectively never run out of addresses again."
    },
    "canonical_form": {
        "title": "Canonical (Short) Form",
        "simple_explanation": "This is the 'clean' version of the address. We remove leading zeros and use the '::' shortcut to make it easier to read and type."
    },
    "expanded_form": {
        "title": "Expanded (Full) Form",
        "simple_explanation": "This shows every single bit of the address explicitly. It's useful for computers and engineers to see exactly what's going on, but it's too long for daily use."
    },
    "network_range": {
        "title": "Network Range",
        "simple_explanation": "This defines the boundaries of your specific slice of the internet. It shows the very first and very last address available to you."
    },
    "total_hosts": {
        "title": "Total Addresses",
        "simple_explanation": "This is the number of unique device addresses available in your network. Even a small home network has more addresses than there are stars in the galaxy."
    },
    "header_version": {
        "title": "Version (4 bits)",
        "simple_explanation": "This field always contains the number 6, confirming that this is an IPv6 packet. It's the very first thing a router checks when seeing a packet."
    },
    "header_traffic_class": {
        "title": "Traffic Class (8 bits)",
        "simple_explanation": "This marks how important or time-sensitive the data is. Video calls get priority over file downloads. It helps routers decide what to send first when they're busy."
    },
    "header_flow_label": {
        "title": "Flow Label (20 bits)",
        "simple_explanation": "This tags all packets belonging to the same conversation (like a video stream) so routers can keep them together and process them efficiently."
    },
    "header_payload_length": {
        "title": "Payload Length (16 bits)",
        "simple_explanation": "This tells routers exactly how much data is being carried after this header. It's the size of the actual content, measured in bytes."
    },
    "header_next_header": {
        "title": "Next Header (8 bits)",
        "simple_explanation": "This tells the receiver what type of content comes next—is it a TCP segment, UDP datagram, or maybe another extension header? It's a roadmap for parsing."
    },
    "header_hop_limit": {
        "title": "Hop Limit (8 bits)",
        "simple_explanation": "This is a countdown that decreases by 1 at each router. When it hits zero, the packet is discarded. This prevents packets from looping forever if there's a routing mistake."
    },
    "header_source_address": {
        "title": "Source Address (128 bits)",
        "simple_explanation": "This is the full IPv6 address of the device that sent the packet. It's 128 bits long—the same addresses we calculate and visualize in this tool!"
    },
    "header_destination_address": {
        "title": "Destination Address (128 bits)",
        "simple_explanation": "This is the full IPv6 address of the intended recipient. Every router along the way reads this to decide where to forward the packet next."
    },
    "eui64_visualizer": {
        "title": "EUI-64 Calculation",
        "simple_explanation": "This demonstrates how an IPv6 address is automatically created from a device's MAC address. It splits the MAC address, inserts 'ff:fe' in the middle, and flips a specific bit to mark it as unique."
