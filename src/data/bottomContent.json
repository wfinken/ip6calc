            "question": "Why do we need IPv6?",
            "answer": "The previous system, IPv4, only had 4.3 billion addresses, which we ran out of in 2011. IPv6 provides 340 undecillion addresses (that's 340 followed by 36 zeros), ensuring we can connect every device on Earth—and other planets—forever."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is a /64?",
            "answer": "A /64 is the standard size for a single network segment, like your home Wi-Fi. It creates 18 quintillion addresses just for your house. This might seem like overkill, but it allows for features like automatic configuration and better security without needing complex router settings."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is IPv6 faster?",
            "answer": "In many cases, yes. IPv6 was designed to be processed more efficiently by routers. It effectively eliminates the need for NAT (Network Address Translation), which is a common slowdown on IPv4 networks. Major content providers like Facebook and Google report that IPv6 is consistently faster for mobile users."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is my old equipment compatible?",
            "answer": "Most modern routers, computers, and phones support IPv6 automatically. However, some very old networking gear might not. You can usually check your connection type in your device's network settings."
